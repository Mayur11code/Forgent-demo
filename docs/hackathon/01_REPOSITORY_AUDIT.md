# 01 — Repository Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-10-30  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Last commit:** `b547a7d Initial commit`  
**Working tree:** clean except `BLUEPRINT.md`, which is untracked (`?? BLUEPRINT.md`)  
**Auditor:** Principal Architect / TPM (documentation baseline)

---

## 1. What is actually in the repository

| Path | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Present | 14 bytes: `# Forgent-demo`. No run instructions, stack or product description. |
| `BLUEPRINT.md` | Present, untracked | 1,606 lines. The canonical ProofHire product and hackathon blueprint. |
| `.gitignore` | Present | Generic Node/Vite/Next ignore list. Includes `.next`, `node_modules`, `.env*`, `dist`, coverage, `.turbo`, `.vite`. For the serverless stack (Neon PostgreSQL + Prisma 7), ensure `.env.local`, `.env*.local`, generated Prisma engine binaries, and database dump artifacts are ignored. |
| `.git/` | Present | Single commit on `main`. |

Nothing else exists. There is **no** `package.json`, lockfile, `src/`, `app/`, `prisma/`, tests, CI workflow, `.env.example`, Dockerfile or deployed configuration.

### Verified environment

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | `v22.18.0` |
| npm | `10.9.3` |
| Git | `2.50.0.windows.1` |
| Platform | Windows (`win32`), repository under `C:\Users\Mayur\Desktop\Forgent-demo` |

### Verified Git state

```text
Branch: main
Commit: b547a7d Initial commit
Status: ?? BLUEPRINT.md
```

**Audit conclusion:** this is a greenfield repository. Every application feature in the blueprint is unimplemented. The documentation must not claim any existing product capability.

---

## 2. Source-of-truth blueprint

The task brief refers to `ProofHire_Final_Solution_Blueprint.md`. The actual file in this repository is:

```text
C:\Users\Mayur\Desktop\Forgent-demo\BLUEPRINT.md
```

It is the same canonical content: ProofHire v2.0, dated 30 October 2026, covering the marketplace, Team Compiler, verification/execution, the Northstar receiving scenario, the 24-hour plan, economics and demo authenticity rules.

**Decision:** `BLUEPRINT.md` remains the canonical product source. The documentation package links to it rather than duplicating it. A future rename to `ProofHire_Final_Solution_Blueprint.md` is optional and should be done as a tracked move with a decision-log entry; do not maintain two copies.

The blueprint is currently **untracked**. It should be committed before implementation so every teammate and checkpoint sees the same product source.

---

## 3. Existing stack and configuration

### What exists

- Git repository and a generic Node `.gitignore`.
- Node 22 and npm 10 on the development machine.
- No application framework, dependency manifest, compiler configuration, database, migration, test runner or runtime.

### What does not exist

- No `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `yarn.lock`.
- No TypeScript configuration or source files.
- No Next.js/React/Vite configuration.
- No database schema, ORM, migrations or seed.
- No API routes or server actions.
- No UI components, design tokens or pages.
- No tests, test fixtures, CI or lint configuration.
- No environment template or secrets policy.
- No existing roadmap, PR plan, tracker or task list.
- No existing documentation directory.

There is therefore **no pre-existing technology stack to preserve**. The stack is a proposal, not a discovered decision. Every stack item is marked `PROPOSED` in [16 — Decisions and Changelog](16_DECISIONS_AND_CHANGELOG.md) until the P0 freeze.

---

## 4. Proposed stack (PROPOSED — freeze at P0)

| Layer | Proposal | Why it fits the 24-hour demo |
|---|---|---|
| App framework | Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict | One deployable app for UI and API; fast route handlers; no separate service to coordinate. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + CSS variables + local component primitives | Premium dark system with token control; no heavy design-system dependency. |
| Components | Radix primitives, `lucide-react` icons | Accessible dialogs/tabs/tooltips without building every primitive. |
| Workflow graph | `@xyflow/react` (React Flow) | Purpose-built node/edge graph with pan, zoom, fit-view and custom node states. |
| Charts | Recharts | Small, record-driven spend/earnings/reputation visuals. |
| Validation | Zod | Shared runtime schemas for API payloads, manifests, contracts and fixtures. |
| ORM / DB | Prisma 7 + Neon PostgreSQL with `@prisma/adapter-neon` serverless adapter | Production-ready serverless database with connection pooling and branching; aligns with the blueprint PostgreSQL requirement. |
| Tests | Vitest for unit/integration; Playwright optional for one happy-path UI smoke | Compiler, verifier and economics require deterministic tests. |
| Execution | Serverless Next.js App Router route handlers with Upstash QStash (`@upstash/qstash`) for durable asynchronous stage execution, retries and step progression | Stateless, durable serverless execution without long-running Node daemon or local queue dependencies; Vercel-ready. |
| Auth | Demo persona cookie and server-side role guard | Enough to demonstrate buyer vs builder permissions; **not** real authentication. |
| Payments | None. Simulated eligibility only | The blueprint prohibits claiming real settlement without a provider. |
| Inventory | Simulated local ledger | 42 → 42 on-hand invariant; commit blocked until human approval. |
| LLM / Adapters | Hybrid adapter architecture: Evidence Reader is model-backed (Gemini/OpenAI via API key) with deterministic fallback; Reconciliation and Verifier are deterministic rules. | Provides authentic AI execution while guaranteeing zero-failure offline demo resilience. |

### Serverless Architecture: Neon PostgreSQL, Prisma 7 and QStash

The blueprint mandates a robust, outcome-driven marketplace with PostgreSQL persistence. The agreed serverless architecture combines:

- **Neon PostgreSQL:** Cloud serverless PostgreSQL with instant branching, connection pooling, and zero local database daemon overhead.
- **Prisma 7 with Serverless Adapter:** `@prisma/adapter-neon` and `@neondatabase/serverless` using WebSocket/HTTP connection pooling via `DATABASE_URL`, with `DIRECT_URL` for direct schema migrations.
- **Upstash QStash:** Durable message and webhook orchestration (`@upstash/qstash`) for asynchronous stage execution, retries, and failure recovery without local background worker processes.
- **Vercel Serverless Deployment:** Next.js App Router deployed as stateless serverless functions.
- **Runtime Validation:** Zod schemas enforcing strict boundaries on all API routes, database models, and agent manifests.

Key conventions:
- Use native PostgreSQL types (`Json` / `jsonb`, native enums or checked strings).
- Use integer paise for money, never floats (`amountPaise Int`).
- Keep database mutations idempotent using unique constraints (e.g. `@@unique([executionId, stageId])`).

This is recorded as `D-002` and frozen at P0.

## 5. Existing features and infrastructure

| Area | Exists? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer/freelancer personas | No | Greenfield. |
| Job posting / acceptance contract | No | Greenfield. |
| Agent registry / versions | No | Greenfield. |
| Capability matching / compiler | No | Greenfield. |
| Audition runner | No | Greenfield. |
| Execution runtime / recovery | No | Greenfield. |
| Independent verifier | No | Greenfield. |
| Evidence receipt | No | Greenfield. |
| Economics / contribution ledger | No | Greenfield. |
| Dashboards | No | Greenfield. |
| Seed/reset | No | Greenfield. |
| Tests / CI | No | Greenfield. |

No feature may be described as "existing" in a demo or document unless it is implemented and verified later.

## 6. Commands and environment requirements

### Available now

```powershell
node --version      # v22.18.0
npm --version       # 10.9.3

npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run db:reset
```

### Environment variables to define

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-sample-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-sample.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
QSTASH_URL="https://qstash.upstash.io/v2"
QSTASH_TOKEN="ey..."
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_..."
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS="true"
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE="true"
DEMO_SEED="wh204-v1"
DEMO_FAILURE_SCENARIO="WH204_DEFAULT_FAILURE"
DEMO_STAGE_DELAY_MS="900"

```

No real payment key or warehouse physical credential is required for the critical path.

### Ports and runtime assumptions

- Next.js App Router on `http://localhost:3000` (Vercel Serverless deployment).
- Neon PostgreSQL cloud database with pooling via `DATABASE_URL` and direct migration via `DIRECT_URL`.
- Durable async task execution orchestrated via Upstash QStash webhooks.
- Single local browser, desktop/laptop viewport 1280–1440 primary.

## 7. Conflicts and gaps between repository reality and the blueprint

| # | Conflict / gap | Resolution recorded |
|---|---|---|
| C-01 | The brief names `ProofHire_Final_Solution_Blueprint.md`; the repository file is `BLUEPRINT.md`. | Treat `BLUEPRINT.md` as canonical; do not duplicate. Decision `D-008`. |
| C-02 | Blueprint suggests PostgreSQL; no local Postgres daemon exists. | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with Prisma 7 (`@prisma/adapter-neon`). Zero local daemon setup needed; aligns with blueprint PostgreSQL mandate. Decision `D-002`. |
| C-03 | Blueprint's receiving example lists five candidate specialists including a Policy Checker and a separate Fallback Reconciler; the task specifies one freelancer with four versions (Evidence Reader, Reconciliation v1.0.0/v1.1.0, Exception Reporter). | Policy validation becomes a deterministic ProofHire capability; v1.1.0 is the compatible fallback. No fake fifth builder. Decision `D-009`, `D-010`, `D-011`. |
| C-04 | Blueprint often speaks of Builders A–E; the task seeds a single freelancer, Jordan Lee. | All builder allocations aggregate to Jordan / Demo Agent Studio; per-agent contributions remain visible. |
| C-05 | Blueprint marks buyer/builder dashboards as "should build if time permits"; the task requires them as part of the demo. | Dashboards and economics views are P0, not optional. |
| C-06 | Blueprint defers public builder onboarding; the task lists agent registration/edit UI. | Implement a demo-scoped registration/edit flow with immutable published versions; no public onboarding or fake third-party acquisition. |
| C-07 | Blueprint says team may use Next.js/Postgres "suggested"; no repository preference exists. | All stack decisions are `PROPOSED` and frozen at P0, not presented as approved facts. |
| C-08 | Blueprint says 8–12 test cases; the plan must be concrete. | Ten fixtures: eight visible, two held-out, versioned `wh204-suite-v1`. Decision `D-015`. |
| C-09 | Blueprint warns that an agent saying "Done" is not proof; the demo needs an independent verifier. | Verifier is a deterministic module owned by ProofHire, excluded from the agent registry and marketplace. |
| C-10 | No task tracker, roadmap or docs exist. | This package creates them under `docs/hackathon/`; `TASK_TRACKER.md` is canonical. |
| C-11 | Blueprint mentions workflow selection; previous draft implied Candidate C was predetermined. | Dynamic selection algorithm implemented: selection is computed from persisted audition runs; Candidate A, B or C can qualify; example 10/10 and ₹10,000 are illustrative. Decision `D-025`. |

No existing user work is overwritten. The only pre-existing files are preserved.

## 8. Technical risks introduced by the greenfield state

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| No scaffold exists; P0 is on the critical path | A slow setup consumes marketplace/compiler time | One owner (B) initialises the project first; A/C work from the frozen contract document in parallel. |
| Neon serverless connection limits | High concurrency can exceed connection pool | Use `@neondatabase/serverless` connection pooler via `DATABASE_URL` with short transactions. |
| In-process async runtime | Next.js hot reload or a crash can interrupt a run | Persist stage state before/after each stage; UI resumes from persisted state; demo reset is one click. |
| Windows paths and line endings | Scripts may break on `/` assumptions | Use Node `path` APIs; enforce LF in Git attributes; document PowerShell commands. |
| Untracked blueprint | Teammates/checkpoints may miss the source | Commit `BLUEPRINT.md` before implementation. |
| No real auth | Role checks are demo-only | Clearly label; enforce role at route level; never claim production security. |
| No CI | Regressions reach the demo | Local gate commands at every phase; P8 regression; tag only after gates. |
| Three developers, 108 tasks | Concurrency conflicts | Frozen contracts, file ownership in 04, typed mocks, one owner per module. |
| Demo depends on laptop runtime | A failed live run loses the story | Seeded backup, reset, offline mode, pre-recorded fallback only if clearly labelled. |
