# 13 — Demo Runbook

**Status:** `PROPOSED — REHEARSE AT P8`  
**Owner:** Team A (delivery), B (environment/reset), C (technical chain)  
**Demo length:** target **3:00**, hard ceiling **3:15**  
**Source of truth:** seeded WH-204 + live APIs; no pre-recorded run unless explicitly labelled as a fallback

---

## 1. Demo thesis

> ProofHire does not just generate a workflow. It compiles a team of independently built agents, auditions competing teams, survives a real failure, verifies the outcome independently, and pays only the work that was accepted.

The three moments the judges must remember:

1. **The compiler chooses with evidence.** A fails on quantities; B has no recovery; C is selected.
2. **The failure is real and recovered.** v1.0.0 fails; v1.1.0 replaces it; downstream reruns.
3. **The economics follow accepted work.** v1.0.0 earns ₹0; v1.1.0 earns ₹2,500; Jordan earns ₹5,500 (simulated).

---

## 3. The three-minute script

### 0:00–0:20 — The physical problem

**Screen:** Buyer overview, WH-204 card.

**Say:**

> “Northstar received a shipment. The purchase order says 12. The invoice says 12. The physical scan found 10. Two boxes are missing, and nobody is allowed to quietly change inventory to make the numbers match.”

**Point at:** 12 / 12 / 10 and the seeded demo label.

**Do not:** explain the entire architecture yet.

---

### 0:20–0:40 — A paid job, not a prompt

**Action:** Open `/buyer/jobs/job-wh-204` → Contract tab.

**Say:**

> “Northstar posted this as a paid outcome: ₹10,000, with a compiled acceptance contract. Ten objective checks, a hard approval gate for inventory, and one retry and one replacement — not unlimited automation.”

**Point at:** expected outcome 10 / 2 / `EXCEPTION_REQUIRES_REVIEW`, inventory `BLOCKED_PENDING_APPROVAL`.

---

### 0:40–1:00 — The independent builder economy

**Action:** Open `/buyer/marketplace` → agent detail for Reconciliation Specialist.

**Say:**

> “The supply side is independent. Jordan Lee runs Demo Agent Studio. He publishes versioned agents with schemas, permissions, prices and limitations. v1.0.0 is the primary. v1.1.0 is a compatible fallback. Jordan earns only when a stage is accepted.”

**Point at:** version timeline, ₹2,500 price, fallback link, seeded/demo label.

**If asked:** “Is this real supply?” → “Seeded demo supply. The marketplace mechanics and attribution are real; the identities and demand are seeded.”

---

### 1:00–1:30 — Dynamic compile and audition of three teams

**Action:** Compiler tab → **Compile** → **Run auditions**.

**Say:**

> “ProofHire compiles three bounded candidates: a single-agent baseline, a fixed specialist team, and a compiler-selected team with a bound fallback. All three audition dynamically on the same ten fixtures and the same seed. Selection is computed in real time from persisted audition runs — Candidate C is not preordained; any candidate can qualify if it passes hard constraints.”

**Point at:**
- Candidates A, B, and C auditioning side-by-side.
- A: fails the physical quantity check (12 vs 10).
- B: passes quantities but has no recovery path.
- C: passes hard constraints and has a compatible fallback (illustrative 10/10 checks, ₹10,000 cost).
- Two held-out cases are aggregated, not exposed.

**Action:** Select C based on measured evaluation results.

**Say:**

> “Hard constraints first. A high score cannot override a critical failure.”

---

### 1:30–1:55 — Approve the ₹10,000 work order

**Action:** Work-order tab → show allocation table → approve.

**Say:**

> “The buyer approves ₹10,000 before execution. Jordan’s stages total ₹5,500. ProofHire’s fee is ₹2,500. ₹1,200 is reserved for execution and recovery, ₹800 for human review. Settlement is simulated eligibility, not a real payment.”

**Do not:** rush past the arithmetic; judges remember coherent money.

---

### 1:55–2:25 — The failure and replacement moment

**Action:** Execution tab → **Start execution**.

**Narrate while it runs:**

> “Six stages. Evidence extraction, reconciliation, policy, exception report, inventory proposal, human approval.”

**At the red failure:**

> “Reconciliation v1.0.0 just returned an invalid schema. The runtime caught it. The raw malformed output is preserved. v1.0.0 is not paid.”

**At the dashed replacement:**

> “ProofHire checks compatibility: same capability, compatible input and output schemas, permissions subset, within reserve. v1.1.0 replaces it. Downstream stages are invalidated and rerun against the new output.”

**At completion:**

> “10 received, 2 discrepancy, exception requires review. Inventory is still 42 committed — the proposal is blocked pending human approval.”

**Pause.** Let the failure and replacement land. This is the signature moment.

---

### 2:25–2:50 — Independent verification and tamper-evident receipt

**Action:** Verification tab → scroll ten checks → Receipt tab.

**Say:**

> “The verifier is not an agent. It is ProofHire's independent deterministic module. It does not trust the agent's success message; it recomputes the quantities from evidence. Ten checks pass. The state diff is 42 → 42 on-hand invariant, pending 10, variance 2. The inventory commit is still blocked. The receipt is tamper-evident and hash-verified with SHA-256.”

**Point at:** the copyable SHA-256 receipt hash, v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 both present, status `VERIFIED_PENDING_HUMAN_APPROVAL`, and explain hash scope.

---

### 2:50–3:10 — The economic loop

**Action:** Open `/builder/earnings` (persona switch).

**Say:**

> “Jordan sees the loop close. Evidence Reader ₹1,500. Reconciliation v1.0.0: ₹0, because it was replaced before an accepted output. v1.1.0: ₹2,500, because it produced the accepted output. Exception Reporter ₹1,000. Total eligible: ₹5,500 — simulated. ProofHire keeps a ₹2,500 fee. No money moves in this demo, but the attribution is real.”

**Point at:** v1.0.0 ₹0 reason, v1.1.0 ₹2,500, total ₹5,500, eligible-simulated label.

---

### 3:10–3:15 — Close

**Say:**

> “A marketplace where agents compete, a compiler that selects with evidence, a runtime that survives failure, and verification that pays only accepted work. That is ProofHire.”

**Stop talking.** Invite questions.

## 4. Timing discipline

| Segment | Target | Cumulative |
|---|---:|---:|
| Problem | 0:20 | 0:20 |
| Paid job | 0:20 | 0:40 |
| Builder economy | 0:20 | 1:00 |
| Compile/audition | 0:30 | 1:30 |
| Work order | 0:25 | 1:55 |
| Failure/recovery | 0:30 | 2:25 |
| Verification/receipt | 0:25 | 2:50 |
| Economics/close | 0:25 | 3:15 |

If running long:

1. Shorten the marketplace tour to one sentence.
2. Skip the policy/inventory stage detail.
3. Show the receipt hash but do not scroll the whole document.
4. Never skip the failure/replacement or the v1.0.0 ₹0 moment.

If running short:

- Open the safe-failure scenario in a second run and explain bounded recovery.
- Show the held-out disclosure.
- Show the receipt JSON export.

---

## 5. Judge questions and answers

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| “Is this just an LLM wrapper?” | “No. The critical path is deterministic: structured contract compilation, hard matching, ten fixtures, a runtime and a verifier. No LLM is required for the demo.” |
| “Are these real agents?” | “They are seeded demo agents with real versioned manifests and deterministic adapters. The marketplace and attribution mechanics are real; supply and demand are seeded.” |
| “Did money actually move?” | “No. Settlement is `ELIGIBLE_SIMULATED`. There is no payment provider. We deliberately do not claim a payout.” |
| “Did inventory change?” | “No. The ledger stays 42 committed, 10 pending, 2 variance. The commit is blocked pending human approval. Inventory is simulated.” |
| “Why pay v1.1.0 and not v1.0.0?” | “Payment follows accepted stage output. v1.0.0 failed schema validation and was replaced before acceptance. Paying both would double-pay the stage and reward failure.” |
| “How do you know the result is correct?” | “The independent verifier recomputes from the PO, invoice and physical scan. It ignores agent self-reported success and checks ten acceptance conditions.” |
| “What if no fallback exists?” | “The run stops `FAILED_SAFE` with preserved evidence, no receipt, no contribution and no payout. We can show that negative path.” |
| “Can an agent commit inventory?” | “No. No agent has `commit:inventory`. A direct attempt is blocked and audited. A human must approve.” |
| “Why three candidates?” | “To make the selection falsifiable: a baseline, a fixed team and a compiled team, all on the same suite and seed. A and B are rejected for recorded reasons.” |
| “Is the baseline a Jordan Lee listing?” | “No. It is an evaluation-only baseline, hidden from the marketplace (`registryVisible=false`), so the comparison is fair.” |
| “What is not real?” | “Auth, payments, inventory integration, public onboarding, historical demand and production scale. Everything simulated is labelled.” |
| “What would you validate next?” | “Buyer willingness to pay, builder acquisition, verification cost per job, dispute rates and real recovery behaviour on messy evidence.” |

## 6. Fallbacks

### 6.1 If the dev server dies

1. Restart `npm run dev`.
2. Reload.
3. Resume from persisted state; do not restart the whole story.
4. If the run is corrupted, reset and replay the three-minute script from 1:00.

### 6.2 If the database is corrupted

1. Stop the server.
2. Restore `backups/demo-seeded.db` to `prisma/dev.db`.
3. Run `npm run db:seed` only if the restore path requires it.
4. Verify health and WH-204 `CONTRACT_READY`.
5. Resume.

### 6.3 If execution hangs

1. Check `/api/health`.
2. Reload the execution tab; polling resumes from persisted state.
3. If still stuck, reset and rerun. Do not fake progress.
4. If the failure injection is the problem, switch to `WH204_CLEAN` only if the runbook explicitly allows it; otherwise use the recorded fallback and label it.

### 6.4 If the network is unavailable

- The critical path requires no external network after install.
- Verify before the demo; do not discover this on stage.

### 6.5 If a UI route fails

- Use the direct URL; do not hunt through navigation.
- If a page is broken, show the API payload in the browser only as a last resort and state that the UI route is the defect.
- Never claim a route works if it does not.

### 6.6 Recorded fallback

A screen recording may be used **only** if:

- It is clearly labelled “recorded fallback”.
- The live failure is explained honestly.
- The judge is told which parts are recorded.
- It is a last resort, not a substitute for rehearsal.

## 7. Troubleshooting quick reference

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Health 503 | DB file missing/locked | `npm run db:push`; restart; check WAL |
| WH-204 missing | Seed not run / wrong DB | `npm run db:reset`; reseed |
| Four versions not visible | Seed incomplete / paused | Run seed integrity query; check `registryVisible` |
| Compile 409 | Job not `CONTRACT_READY` | Reset; verify status |
| Auditions slow | Stage delay too high | Lower `DEMO_STAGE_DELAY_MS`; rerun |
| No failure shown | Scenario is `WH204_CLEAN` | Set `WH204_DEFAULT_FAILURE`; reset |
| No replacement | v1.1.0 missing/paused | Reseed; verify fallback link |
| Receipt hash changes | Non-canonical timestamp/order | Fix canonicalisation; do not hide |
| Earnings ₹0 | Verification not passed | Check verification tab and contribution rows |
| Reset fails | Demo mode flag off / FK issue | Check `DEMO_MODE`; inspect reset order |
| Wrong persona | Cookie stale | Switch persona; reload |

## 8. Claims discipline

### Say

- “Seeded demo supply.”
- “Simulated eligibility.”
- “Simulated inventory ledger.”
- “Measured on `wh204-suite-v1`.”
- “Independent deterministic verifier.”
- “In this demo.”

### Do not say

- “Real payments.”
- “Live warehouse integration.”
- “Production-ready.”
- “Certified.”
- “Thousands of agents.”
- “Guaranteed earnings.”
- “The AI decided.”
- “Fully autonomous inventory.”

If a judge asks a question whose honest answer is “we did not build that,” say so. The demo's credibility depends on the boundary being clear.

---

## 9. Post-demo checklist

- [ ] Reset the demo to `CONTRACT_READY` for the next judge.
- [ ] Close the receipt/execution tabs.
- [ ] Return to `/buyer/overview`.
- [ ] Note any defect or judge question in the decision log.
- [ ] If a run failed, record the cause and the fallback used.
- [ ] Keep the backup untouched.
