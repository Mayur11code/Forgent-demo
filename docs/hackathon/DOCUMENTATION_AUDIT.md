# Documentation Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-10-30  
**Auditor:** Documentation/architecture review  
**Scope:** `docs/hackathon/**`, root `README.md`, canonical `BLUEPRINT.md`  
**Result:** **PASS with conditions** — documentation is internally consistent and implementation-ready; every stack/interface decision remains proposed until P0; no application source, dependency, package or migration was changed.

---

## 1. Audit method

1. Enumerated the repository and verified Git state.
2. Read `BLUEPRINT.md` in full and mapped its sections to the package.
3. Inventoried every required document.
4. Parsed `TASK_TRACKER.csv` and cross-checked it with `TASK_TRACKER.md`.
5. Validated task IDs, statuses, phases, dependencies, counts and minutes.
6. Validated the 24-hour phase windows, gates, tags and 18-field phase structure.
7. Checked every relative Markdown link.
8. Traced the demo economic loop and canonical WH-204 values across documents.
9. Audited seeded/simulated/deferred labelling and prohibited claims.
10. Verified no application source, package, dependency or migration file exists/changed.

## 2. Repository state at audit

```text
Branch: main
Commit: b547a7d Initial commit
Status:
  M README.md          (documentation pointer only)
  ?? BLUEPRINT.md      (canonical product source, untracked)
  ?? docs/             (this documentation package, untracked)
```

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `package.json` exists? | No |
| `src/` exists? | No |
| `prisma/` exists? | No |
| `node_modules/` exists? | No |
| Application source modified? | No |
| Dependency/lockfile modified? | No |
| Migration modified? | No |
| Existing user work overwritten? | No |

Root `README.md` was replaced with a documentation pointer. It is not application source and contains no product implementation claim.

## 4. Task tracker validation

### 4.1 Counts

| Measure | Expected | Actual | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Total tasks | 108 | 108 | PASS |
| DONE | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| DROPPED | 2 | 2 | PASS |
| Actionable remaining | 106 | 106 | PASS |
| Critical path | 46 | 46 | PASS |
| A tasks | 40 | 40 | PASS |
| B tasks | 34 | 34 | PASS |
| C tasks | 34 | 34 | PASS |
| Total estimated minutes | 3,535 | 3,535 | PASS |
| Core estimated minutes | 3,425 | 3,425 | PASS |
| Integration buffer | 895 | 895 | PASS |
| P0 tasks | 9 | 9 | PASS |
| P1 tasks | 10 | 10 | PASS |

| P6 tasks | 13 | 13 | PASS |
| P7 tasks | 11 | 11 | PASS |
| P8 tasks | 12 | 12 | PASS |

### 4.2 Integrity

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Duplicate IDs | None |
| Invalid phases | None |
| Invalid statuses | None |
| Self-dependencies | None |
| Unresolved dependencies | None |
| DROPPED rows with minutes > 0 | None |
| Deferred rows present | `P5-A-005`, `P7-B-004` (0 min) |
| Optional rows present | 5 (`P3-A-006`, `P5-A-004`, `P6-A-005`, `P7-A-004`, `P8-C-004`: 110 min) |
| Every CSV ID appears in Markdown | Yes (108/108) |
| Unique IDs in Markdown vs CSV | 108 vs 108 |
| Pre-marked done | None |

### 4.3 Required task fields

The Markdown task tables include ID, owner, priority, kind, implementation, dependencies, outputs, acceptance criteria, minutes, parallelization, status, blocker and verification. The CSV includes these plus phase, critical-path flag, title and description. **PASS.**

### 4.4 Status honesty

The package consistently states implementation has not started. No task is marked `IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW` or `DONE`. Two deferred items are marked `DROPPED` with zero minutes and a reason in the register. **PASS.**

---

## 5. Schedule and phase validation

### 5.1 Windows

| Phase | Window | Minutes |
|---|---|---:|
| P0 | H0–H1 | 60 |
| P1 | H1–H4 | 180 |
| P2 | H4–H7 | 180 |
| P3 | H7–H10 | 180 |
| P4 | H10–H13 | 180 |
| P5 | H13–H16 | 180 |
| P6 | H16–H18 | 120 |
| P7 | H18–H21 | 180 |
| P8 | H21–H23 | 120 |
| P9 | H23–H24 | 60 |
| **Total** | **H0–H24** | **1,440** |

**Result:** sums exactly to 24 hours. No gap or overlap.

### 5.2 Phase structure

- Ten phases P0–P9 (P0–P8 development/hardening, P9 unallocated contingency buffer). **PASS.**
- Each phase has a named gate outcome. **PASS.**
- Each phase has a usable prototype statement. **PASS.**
- Each phase has a checkpoint tag (`p0-foundation` … `p9-lock`). **PASS.**
- `03_PHASE_BREAKDOWN.md` contains all **18 required fields** for all phases. **PASS.**
- Three permanent workstreams A/B/C; no Team D. **PASS.**
- QA/integration/demo ops distributed across A/B/C and joint gates. **PASS.**

### 5.3 Capacity and buffer audit

| Phase | A core (tot) | B core (tot) | C core (tot) | Window | Capacity Finding |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| P0 | 55 (55) | 55 (55) | 55 (55) | 60 | PASS (5m buffer) |
| P1 | 160 (160) | 145 (145) | 140 (140) | 180 | PASS (20–40m buffer) |
| P2 | 160 (160) | 160 (160) | 150 (150) | 180 | PASS (20–30m buffer) |
| P3 | 160 (185) | 155 (155) | 160 (160) | 180 | PASS (20–25m buffer per dev; auditions run on persisted evaluations) |
| P4 | 160 (160) | 175 (175) | 180 (180) | 180 | PASS (0–20m buffer; dynamic selection persisted, recovery execution) |
| P5 | 150 (170) | 165 (165) | 155 (155) | 180 | PASS (15–30m buffer; verifier, receipt, review, demo reset) |
| P6 | 105 (125) | 110 (110) | 105 (105) | 120 | PASS (10–15m core buffer; duplicate prevention) |
| P7 | 100 (120) | 85 (85) | 120 (120) | 180 | PASS (60–95m buffer; no-mock integration & negative regressions) |
| P8 | 95 (95) | 90 (90) | 75 (100) | 120 | PASS (20–45m buffer for 3 rehearsals and release lock) |
| P9 | 0 (0) | 0 (0) | 0 (0) | 60 | PASS (60m contingency window; 180 person-minutes reserve) |

**Result:** PASS. Core workload is rebalanced to 3,425 minutes across the team (Team A: 1,145m core; Team B: 1,140m core; Team C: 1,140m core). Every workstream operates within its timebox in all 9 phases, leaving 895 minutes (~15 person-hours, or ~5 hours per dev) of integration buffer. Team A capacity deficit is completely resolved.

| Blueprint section | Covered by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Executive summary / promise / not | `02`, `12`, `13` | Covered |
| 2. Problem | `02`, `13` | Covered |
| 3. Three engines | `02` (architecture), `10`, `11`, `12` | Covered |

**Core features present:** marketplace, builder identity, versioning, compiler, audition, selection, work order, execution, failure/recovery, independent verification, receipt, human approval, contribution attribution, settlement eligibility, reputation, demo. **No core feature omitted.**

**Intentional deviations from the blueprint** (documented as conflicts/decisions):

- Serverless Neon PostgreSQL (Prisma 7 + `@prisma/adapter-neon`) and QStash background execution (`D-002`, `D-005`).
- Deterministic adapters instead of model calls (`D-003`).
- Policy/inventory/verifier are platform-owned, not marketplace agents (`D-009`).
- Hidden baseline instead of a fifth visible specialist (`D-010`).
- v1.1.0 as the fallback (`D-011`).
- Single builder (Jordan) instead of Builders A–E (`D-013` context, `12`).
- Dashboards are P0, not “if time permits” (`D-017`).
- Demo-scoped registration, not public onboarding (`D-018`).
- Ten fixtures, eight visible/two held out (`D-015`).

None contradicts a core product promise.

## 7. Demo economic loop audit

| Element | Presence | Consistency |
|---|---|---|
| Seeded buyer Northstar Warehouse | `01`, `08`, `09`, `13` | Consistent |
| Seeded builder Jordan Lee / Demo Agent Studio | `01`, `08`, `09`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Four visible agent versions | `08`, `09`, `10`, `12` | Consistent |
| Hidden evaluation baseline | `07`, `08`, `10` | Consistent (`registryVisible=false`) |
| WH-204 job and contract | `07`, `08`, `09`, `13` | Consistent |
| Injected failure v1.0.0 | `07`, `10`, `11`, `13` | Consistent |
| Compatible fallback v1.1.0 | `07`, `10`, `11`, `13` | Consistent |
| Recovery/downstream rerun | `11`, `13` | Consistent |
| Independent verifier / ten checks | `07`, `11`, `14` | Consistent |
| Receipt with SHA-256 | `07`, `11`, `13` | Consistent |
| Blocked inventory commit | `07`, `08`, `11`, `13` | Consistent |
| v1.0.0 ₹0 | `11`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| v1.1.0 ₹2,500 | `11`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Builder total ₹5,500 | `02`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Platform fee ₹2,500 | `02`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Reserves ₹1,200/₹800 | `02`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Buyer total ₹10,000 | `02`, `08`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |
| Simulated eligibility | `07`, `11`, `12`, `13` | Consistent |

### Arithmetic

```text
200,000 + 250,000 + 100,000 = 550,000 builder subtotal
550,000 + 250,000 + 120,000 + 80,000 = 1,000,000 buyer total
```

**PASS.** No document assigns the reconciliation allocation to v1.0.0. No document claims a real payout or inventory mutation.

---

## 8. Simulation and claims audit

| Claim | Where handled | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Seeded profiles labelled | `README`, `08`, `09`, `12`, `13` | PASS |
| Payments simulated / eligibility only | `07`, `11`, `12`, `13` | PASS |
| Inventory simulated / no mutation | `07`, `08`, `11`, `13` | PASS |
| Execution cost measured locally, not real billing | `12` | PASS |
| Reputation demo-derived, not public rating | `09`, `12` | PASS |
| Baseline hidden from marketplace | `07`, `08`, `10` | PASS |
| Verifier not an agent | `07`, `11` | PASS |
| Deferred features have no UI | `09`, `15`, `16` | PASS |
| No real auth claim | `01`, `04`, `16` | PASS |
| No production scale/SLA claim | `01`, `12`, `15` | PASS |

### Prohibited claims scan

The package contains “paid”, “settled”, “live inventory” and similar phrases only in:

- Negative guidance (“never say…”, “do not claim…”).
- Descriptions of what is **not** implemented.
- The simulated status name `ELIGIBLE_SIMULATED`.
- The builder story (“earns”) explicitly qualified as simulated eligibility.

No affirmative claim of a real payment, live warehouse integration, certified security or production readiness was found. **PASS.**

## 9. Link and ID audit

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Relative Markdown links in `docs/hackathon/**` | All resolve (19/19 files, re-checked after this file was written) |
| Relative links in root `README.md` | All resolve |
| Anchors used in key links | Point to existing headings |
| Task ID references in dependency fields | All resolve |
| Task IDs in prose | Match canonical tracker IDs |
| Duplicate task IDs | None |
| Cross-document phase names | Consistent P0–P8 |
| Cross-document tags | Consistent |
| Cross-document economic values | Consistent |
| Cross-document status labels | Consistent |

**Note:** the link check was re-run after `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md` and the last documentation edits; all relative links in the 19 Markdown files resolve. Re-run the command below after any future edit.

---

## 10. Consistency findings

| # | Finding | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Tracker and CSV counts could diverge if one is edited alone | Medium | `05` and `06` define Markdown as canonical and require joint updates/regeneration. |
| F-02 | Initial workload left Team A with only 10m buffer | High (Capacity) | **Resolved:** Workload rebalanced to 3,425 core minutes (Team A: 1,145m, Team B: 1,140m, Team C: 1,140m), creating 895m (~15h) team integration buffer. Decisions `D-014` and `D-026`. |
| F-03 | Receipt immutability claims overreached | Medium | **Resolved:** Replaced with tamper-evident, hash-verified receipt terminology; documented SHA-256 limitations (payload integrity vs physical truth vs non-repudiation). Decision `D-021`. |
| F-04 | Stack and contracts are proposed, not implemented | High (honesty) | Marked `PROPOSED — FREEZE AT P0` throughout; inventory confirms no code exists. |
| F-05 | Blueprint names a different file (`ProofHire_Final_Solution_Blueprint.md`) | Low | `01` records C-01 and `D-008`: `BLUEPRINT.md` is canonical; no duplicate. |
| F-06 | Blueprint suggests Postgres; serverless deployment required | Medium | `D-002`: Neon PostgreSQL + Prisma 7 (`@prisma/adapter-neon`) for serverless deployment with QStash async execution. |
| F-07 | Blueprint's builder cast differs from the single-builder demo | Medium | `01` C-03/C-04 and `D-009`/`D-011`: one builder, four versions, platform functions. |
| F-08 | Deferred features could leak into navigation | Medium | `09` route list and `D-019` prohibit them; tracker marks `P5-A-005`/`P7-B-004` dropped. |
| F-09 | Task estimates include optional work | Low | Counts separate 3,535 total from 3,425 core (110m optional scope); cut order defined. |
| F-10 | No implementation means no runtime evidence yet | Expected | Every gate requires future evidence; no gate is marked passed. |
| F-11 | Candidate C selection appeared preordained | Medium | **Resolved:** Dynamic selection algorithm specified; Candidate A, B or C can qualify; example 10/10 and ₹10,000 are illustrative. Decision `D-025`. |
| F-12 | Adapter authenticity was ambiguous | Medium | **Resolved:** Hybrid adapter architecture defined: Evidence Reader is model-backed with deterministic fallback; Reconciliation is deterministic rules; no false AI claims. Decision `D-003`. |
| F-13 | Duplicate earnings risk on retries/fallbacks | Medium | **Resolved:** `ContributionRecord` enforces `@@unique([executionId, stageId])`; failed v1.0.0 receives ₹0; replacement v1.1.0 receives ₹2,500; total reconciles to ₹10,000. Decision `D-027`. |

No contradictory core value (10/2, 42/10/2, ₹10,000/₹5,500/₹2,500, v1.0.0 ₹0, v1.1.0 ₹2,500) was found.

## 11. What is deliberately not proven

The documentation does **not** prove:

- That the app builds or runs.
- That the compiler/auditions produce the expected results.
- That the verifier passes ten checks.
- That the receipt hash is stable.
- That the economics reconcile at runtime.
- That the demo can be delivered in 3:15.
- That buyers will pay, builders will join, or the platform is viable.

Those are implementation and validation tasks in P0–P8 and post-hackathon experiments. The package is a plan, not evidence of a built product.

---

## 12. Conditions for implementation start

1. Review and accept `D-001`…`D-027` at P0.
2. Commit `BLUEPRINT.md` so every teammate sees the same source.
3. Verify Node 22/npm 10 and the proposed dependency versions install cleanly.
4. Freeze contracts in `07` and sign `P0-C-003`.
5. Freeze seed IDs/values in `08`.
6. Start with `P0-B-001`; do not pre-mark tasks done.
7. At each gate, attach real evidence and tag the checkpoint.

If any condition fails, record a decision and update the affected documents before proceeding.
